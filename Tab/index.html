          HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for
          creating web pages and web applications. It provides the structure and
          content of a web page by using a set of markup tags. HTML tags define
          different elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images,
          forms, and more. Web browsers use HTML to interpret and display the
          content of web pages to users. HTML is a cornerstone technology of the
          World Wide Web and is often used alongside CSS and JavaScript to
          create visually appealing and interactive web experiences.

          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for
          describing the presentation of a document written in HTML. CSS defines
          how HTML elements should be displayed on screen, in print, or in other
          media. It allows developers to control the layout, design, and
          appearance of web pages, including aspects such as colors, fonts,
          spacing, positioning, and responsiveness. CSS works by selecting HTML
          elements and applying styles to them using rules and selectors. By
          separating content from presentation, CSS enables developers to create
          consistent and visually appealing designs across multiple pages and
          devices, enhancing the user experience of web applications.

          JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming
          language used primarily for building interactive web content. It
          enables client-side scripting, allowing developers to create dynamic
          user interfaces and enhance web pages with features like form
          validation and content updates. JavaScript is also used for
          server-side development with frameworks like Node.js, enabling
          full-stack development in a single language. Its versatility extends
          to mobile and desktop app development, game development, and
          serverless application development. Overall, JavaScript is a crucial
          tool for modern web development, offering flexibility and
          interactivity across various platforms and applications.

          React.js is an open-source JavaScript library for building user
          interfaces. It facilitates the creation of interactive web
          applications by providing a component-based architecture, allowing
          developers to build reusable UI components. React utilizes a virtual
          DOM for efficient rendering, improving performance by updating only
          the necessary parts of the page. With its declarative syntax and JSX
          extension, React enables developers to write intuitive and expressive
          code. It follows a unidirectional data flow pattern, enhancing
          predictability and maintainability. React.js is widely used in modern
          web development for creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
